vision_opencv
=============
# Introduction
Ros2 vison_opencv contains packages for interfacing ROS2 with [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) which is a library designed for computational efficiency and strong focus for real time computer vision applications. What packages it contains is as follows:
* `cv_bridge`: Bridge between ROS2 image messages and OpenCV image representation
* `image_geometry`: Collection of methods for dealing with image and pixel geometry
In order to use ROS2 with OpenCV, please see the details within [cv_bridge](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/tree/ros2/cv_bridge) package and OpenCV is a system dependency

# Known issues
Now the ros2 cv_bridge is maintained here and the ros2 image_geometry is on the way, however, OSRF has an usable [image_geometry](https://github.com/ros2/vision_opencv/tree/ros2/image_geometry) and please refer to it to leverage in case of quick practice requirement
